# Process Workshops

## Leap Years


```
All years divisible by 400 ARE leap years (e.g. 2000 was a leap year)
```
```
All years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are NOT leap years (e.g. 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not leap years)
```
```
All years divisible by 4 and not by 100 ARE leap years (e.g. 2004, 2008 and 2012 were leap years)
```
```
All years not divisible by 4 are NOT leap years (e.g. 2009, 2010 and 2011 were not leap years)
```

### Extension Options

```
Write a program that takes a start year and an end year and returns an array of all the leap years between.
```
```
Write a program that when given a year, will return the closest leap year (this could be before or after the given year)
```
